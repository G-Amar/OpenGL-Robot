#Hierarchical Robot Model in OpenGL

Left leg of the robot animates the step.

'w' to do the step animation, 'W' resets the joint angles.

'c' to begin spinning of the body cannon, 'C' to stop it.

Pressing will select the respective joint for the right leg, after which it can be rotated with LEFT_ARROW and RIGHT_ARROW
	'b' - body joint
	'h' - hip joint
	'k' - knee joint

Did the bonus for the arms and arm animation (right arm animates), done with 'a', 'A' to reset arm joints.

Did bonus for constructing own matricies.

Also added the ability to rotate the entire robot, 
use 's' and 'S' to rotate it horizontally and
use 'v' and 'V' to rotate it vertically and get a better view angle.

'q' and 'Q' exit the program.
